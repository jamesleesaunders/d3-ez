## D3 Easy Reusable Graphs, Charts and Components

**D3.EZ** is a library of reusable graphs and charts which use [D3](http://www.d3js.org/).

The d3.ez.js and d3.ez.min.js files are built from source files in the js directory. 
Do not edit d3.ez.js directly. Instead, edit the source files, and then run make to build the generated files.
