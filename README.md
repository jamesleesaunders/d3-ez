## D3 Easy Reusable Graphs, Charts and Components
**D3.EZ** is a library of reusable graphs and charts which use [D3](http://www.d3js.org/). Inspired by Mike Bostock's tutorial [Towards Reusable Charts](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/), the aim of the library is to harness the power of D3, whilst simplifing the process of creating graphs and charts making D3. **D3.EZ** makes it easier for people who are still learning JavaScript or D3 to quickly produce data visualisations with mimimal code.

**D3.EZ** also aims to make it easier to create interactive visulisations and dashboards with graphs which are clickable and linkable, see the D3.EZ showcase below for examples.

For reference there are a few other reusable D3 chart libraries similar to D3.JS indluding:
